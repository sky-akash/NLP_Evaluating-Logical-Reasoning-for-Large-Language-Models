But honeybees do not need so complicated a mechanism to communicate that information. Forager honeybees returning to their hive simply leave a scent trail from the food source they have just visited. There must ttherefore be some other explanation for the honeybees' dance. Winifred: Not necessarily. Most animals have several ways of accomplishing critical tasks.
